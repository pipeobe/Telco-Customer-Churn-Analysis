# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis

Conducted data analysis to understand the Telco Customer Churn Data set. The data consisted of a variety of
variable and attribute types, each of which was used to analyze the data set. The collected data
contained attributes which related to the consumer usage at the Telco Company. A total of 7043
rows represented different customers, and 20 columns represented different attributes of the
same customer. The attributes were defined in the headings of the column. The attributes
consisted of gender, age range, partners or dependents, these attributes can be classified as
the customersâ€™ demographic information. Furthermore, attributes such as account information,
length of service, contact, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges,
phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech assistance,
and streaming TV and movies were also all provided for the analysis.

The goal of the analysis is to determine to predict and anticipate the behavior of the
customer in relation to churning or leaving the company. In addition, the analysis would allow
Telco to determine how best to retain consumers, and what services result in customers leaving
the company. This forecast will be done by analyzing the 20 attributes, each of which will be
compared and analyzed with the churning column. We will focus on how attributes correlate with
each other and with churning. Identification and removal of corrupt data is also a key part in the
data preprocessing part.
Furthermore, the following algorithms were used: Logistic Regression, Decision tree and
Random Forest and the following to evaluate the data: the holdout method, bootstrap method
and cross-validation. The end goal of this analysis is to predict what is causing customers to
churn from the company and if it is possible to retain these customers.
